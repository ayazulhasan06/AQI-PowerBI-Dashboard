An **end-to-end Power BI dashboard project** analyzing **Air Quality Index (AQI)** data to uncover pollution trends, identify dominant pollutants, and compare regional air quality using **Power Query, DAX, and interactive visualizations**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **complete Business Intelligence lifecycle** using Power BI:

**Data Ingestion → Data Cleaning → Data Modeling → DAX Measures → Interactive Dashboard**

The dashboard enables users to analyze AQI data dynamically across **Year, State, and City**, making it ideal for **portfolio presentation, interviews, and real-world BI reporting**.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Air quality data is often:
- Large and inconsistent  
- Difficult to analyze without proper categorization  
- Hard to interpret for decision-making  

This project solves these challenges by:
- Cleaning and standardizing AQI data
- Categorizing AQI based on health impact levels
- Identifying key pollutants affecting air quality
- Presenting insights through interactive dashboards
